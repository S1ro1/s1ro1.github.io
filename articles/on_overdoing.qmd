# On struggling

This blog is a bit different than rest. This is going to be bunch of random nonsense, about topics that have been going through my mind. Mostly about struggling and balancing.
Recently I have been more productive as ever, working long hours every day, shipping amazing stuff at work. When I'm not working, I read. Papers, blogs, articles, everything. I consume more knowledge as ever before. But despite that, I have been struggling,comparing myself, to others, to what I could be, to anything and anyone.

Sometimes, it leaves me wondering, is it even worth it? What benefit lies there in learning if there is a plethora of people infinitely smarter and better than me? Call that an impostor
syndrome if you will. When do I get to a point "I see and I understand". However, this struggle didn't make me stop learning, the other way around.

# On realizing

A saying says "Journey is much more beatiful than the destination", and the same applies in this situation. I was preparing for a lecture on on a course by my friend Zach. The topic
is large scale expert-parallelism. I explicitly asked for this topic, as I wasn't entirely familiar with it, I didn't have an in-depth grasp. I wanted to learn, to understand. And that's the thing that made it beautiful, I ran benchmarks, read papers, reimplemented stuff from scratch, all just to understand, to have the intuition. I used to wake up in the middle of the night, realizing a mistake made the day before, noticing
a thing overlooked.

Then I was done, I understood the limitations, derived the equations, saw the benchmarks prove my theorems. It was beautiful and I was satisfied... And then I wasn't anymore.
I realized, trying to find another thing to pursue, to obsess over, that the journey makes the experience thrilling, not the goal, understanding is not
the purpose, learning is.

# On balancing

And so I was stuck in this endless cycle of feeling bad for not understanding or feeling bad for not learning. Trying to balance the scales. There has to be balance to find, and I found it? The lecture, if any, to be taken from this collection of my thoughts, is that pursuing goals is healthy, it's in our nature and who are we to dispute that. It is in our hands to feel good about the pursue, feel good about not knowing and not understanding. Because from this lack of understanding comes the thrill of pursuing that knowledge.
We should pursue knowledge, we should move forward. Though, this pursuit shouldn't be fueled by comparison of ourselves to others, it HAS to be fueled by our own willpower.
The comparison is what makes you struggle, the comparison kills the joy of learning.

It's totally okay to be worse than others, it's not okay to not try to be better.
