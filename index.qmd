# About

My name is Matej, but everyone calls me Siro. I'm a student of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning @ Brno University of Technology.

I work at ðŸ¤— Hugging Face, where you can mostly find me working on distributed training and inference in [accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) and [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

I'm also one of the core maintainers of [Cluster Bot](https://github.com/gpu-mode/discord-cluster-manager). As you might have guessed, I'm mostly interested in AI and where it intersects with systems programming.

## Articles

When I feel like it, I like to write about random topics from the world of AI and HPC. If any of this interests you, I believe you can find something useful below.
